# Protocol for self-governance in blockchain-enabled charitable organizations
The Blockchain technology has made a major breakthrough in various domains since its inception, namely in the financial sector where the popularization of Bitcoin has truly revolutionized the way we perform transactions. In a world ever so connected and in an era of globalization, the buzz of Bitcoin has brought to light the advantages of its underlying technology. In this context, one of many fields that could truly benefit from the Blockchain is philanthropy. Indeed, by enhancing the transparency of costs and reducing the fees of international transactions, more funds can reach the people in need more efficiently and rapidly while bringing more trust into the process. However, new technologies retrofitted to concepts that have existed long before the industrial age can present some limitations. In this paper, we tackle one of many issues that arises with respect to governance in blockchain-enabled charity organizations and propose a novel protocol for allocating voting tokens and funds and vetting projects. The protocol proposed could be fitted to any charity organization to run in a truly trustless setting while being resistant to corruption.
